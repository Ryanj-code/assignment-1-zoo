        Peafowl or peacocks for males and peahens for females are forest birds that nest on the ground but roost in trees. 
        They live in forests, bushland, farmland, and other warm regions with easy access to low trees. 
        Peafowl are omnivores which means that they eat both plant and animal matter.
